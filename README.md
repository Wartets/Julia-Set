# Julia Set Viewer

A web-based Julia Set viewer that allows users to explore the intricate and beautiful fractals generated by Julia functions. The project provides an interactive environment where users can adjust parameters such as the equation, maximum iterations, and resolution to visualize different Julia sets.

## Features

- **Dynamic Julia Set generation** based on user-defined equations.
- **Interactive controls** to adjust the function, maximum iterations, and resolution.
- **Zoom and pan functionality** to explore the fractal in detail.
- **Real-time rendering** with almost "instant" updates on parameter changes.
- **Equation input** to experiment with different complex functions.

## Usage

1. **Equation Input**: Enter a Julia set equation in the input field, such as `z^2 + 0.355 + 0.355i` (default), and click **OK** to apply. The Julia set will update based on the function provided.
2. **Set maximum number of iterations**: Use the “Max Iterations” slider to define the colorization adjustment interval.
3. **Adjust Resolution**: Use the "Resolution Factor" slider to control the resolution of the displayed fractal. A lower value will provide finer details but require more processing power.
4. **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, focusing on the center of the mouse pointer.
5. **Pan**: Click and drag the canvas to move around the fractal and explore different areas.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the viewer.
- `static/css/style.css`: The CSS file for styling the viewer.
- `static/js/script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic to generate the Julia set and handle user interactions.

## Dependencies

- **Math.js**: math library used for handling complex numbers and calculations.
